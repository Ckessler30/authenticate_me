# !Quora Overview

### Project Description
For my first solo project I chose to clone the website, Quora.  Using a backend of express and sequelize to house and route all of my data and using a frontend of React and Redux to make the user experience as nice as possible when navigating the site.  It was a blast to take this on and try to make this as aesthetically and functionally like Quora as possible.



### Features

#### Questions
Users have the ability to create questions, edit their own questions, and delete their own questions.


#### Answers
Users have the ability to create answers to particular questions as well as edit and delete their answers.


#### Comments
Users have the ability to create comments on other users answers, as well as their own answers.  Editing and deleting your own comments is also just as seamless in the UI.


...Many more features to come

### Notable Difficulties
Being my first solo project it was definitley a task to get used to the workflow of React and Redux by myself, where each feature was built out fully before moving onto the next.  I had a great learning experience in doing so and made it through several bumps in the road to get this to presentation level.
